# Canteen Management System
The Canteen Management System is a fast ordering system used to improve the service quality of the canteen. It uses to replace the old ordering system that prints coupons and manually maintaining a record of its usage. It can help to keep track of daily activities carried out in a canteen and calculate the monthly sales. The system can also allow the vendor to define their food menu and it is categorized in the categories of food, beverages, desserts, and snacks. The system provides cashless payment such as **cards** and **eWallet** to reduce the transaction time. Our targeted users are the vendors of the canteens and also the customers of the canteens like students.
